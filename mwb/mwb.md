## What is [Mentors Without Borders](https://www.mentorswithoutborders.net/)?

> Mentors Without Borders is a group of passionate professionals who want to teach young people from all over the world how to enjoy the process of setting goals and taking steps towards these goals in their chosen fields. 

- So their focus is on teaching "passion" before "skill".

## Why MWB?

- They target the underpriveledged youth whose basic aim in life is mostly survival.
- Unlike us, they don't have "new year resolutions" or goals in life.
- So giving proper guidance to them is important before giving skill.

## How MWB?

- They teach the kids 3 menthods that help them generate ideas and move towards them:
